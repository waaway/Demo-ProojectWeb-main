                our Meditation Loungers. This technology has been used to treat PTSD and 
                addiction and has recently been making its way into the spa world. 
                The loungers remove distractions and allow you to melt into a meditation 
                practice quickly and easily, leading to unprecedented levels of relaxation. 
                When you're short on time but in need of a reset, a 20-minute session in the 
                meditation room is the perfect solution."
